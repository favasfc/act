<p>Interior
 design and decoration in a restaurant is included in the important 
things in a restaurant planning besides the menu that offered. Interior 
design and its decoration are very important because it is closely 
related to the customers. While customers and visitors are enjoying the 
food your restaurant served, they also have to enjoy the surrounding 
environment with good interior planning.</p>



<p>In
 interior design study, interior planning in a room or spaces affects 
the psychology of its users. Good interior design can boost and raise 
the mood of whoever in the rooms or spaces. Otherwise, bad and unplanned
 interior design can decrease the mood of the users. They can feel 
uncomfortable and can’t stand or stay for too long inside the room.</p>



<p>This
 also applies to the planning of a restaurant. Before you want to 
redesign and redecorate, think about what style or theme you want to 
apply to the restaurant. Sure you have to design your restaurant 
based/similar to what your restaurant offer. If you serve traditional 
food, of course, it’s gonna be weird if you apply a retro interior 
design. Do your personal research or call interior design services for 
this.</p>



<p>Based on my 
personal experiences and my own research about the restaurant, cafe, or 
coffee shop business that developed lately around me, so often I visited
 a cafe with zero taste but outstanding design. But it’s always crowded 
with customers. Sadly, they only came to the restaurant to take a photo 
for hours while they only order a cup of coffee. In the end, this 
restaurant doesn’t last. No matter how pretty the interior decoration 
is, a restaurant has to have its own distinctive taste. It would be 
great if the restaurant has both good tastes and good interior 
decoration. (Don’t forget to improve the services too!)</p>



<p>I  suggest you <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar replaceWithoutSep" id="4" data-gr-id="4">to</g> call interior design services for this because <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">it’s  quite</g> complex to design/decorate public spaces like restaurant since <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">it  has</g> many considerations. Thank you Miyan for the answer request, <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">good  luck</g> to you in decorating your restaurant and good luck to <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8">your  restaurant</g> business.</p>
